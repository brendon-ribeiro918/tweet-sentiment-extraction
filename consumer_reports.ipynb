I was told i needed to mail them an FTC report and dispute letter to get my money back. I completed all of this and when i called again they said they transferred the account back to speedy cash for fraud review and I would need to contact them.

He never responded and turned over me to collections Merchants and Professional Collection Bureau , Inc. I sent them a letter describing exactly this issue and instead of not contacting me and verifying my debt they start reporting this debt to the credit reporting agencies. They never verified the debt, like I asked and they never stopped it from being reported when I specifically told them not to, due to the circumstances above.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       ...

By the time the payment posts, 2-3 days of additional interest will have accrued and my payments will apply more to interest than is due today, the day that I'm attempting to pay. My understanding was that I could make a payment at any time but this does not appear to be true.

Confirmation number-XXXX. After realizing it was not my account, I called back to get my money back and inform them of the mistake. I was told i needed to mail them an FTC report and dispute letter to get my money back. I completed all of this and when i called again they said they transferred the account back to speedy cash for fraud review and I would need to contact them.

My understanding was that I could make a payment at any time but this does not appear to be true. The funds are available in my bank account today regardless of whether Nelnet can collect over the weekend. I should not be penalized for this. \\n\\nI submitted complaint XXXX in XXXX for other deceptive practices with Nelnet. They have not yet resolved the issue identified in that complaint or contacted me as they said they would in their response. I believe this new issue is just one more deceptive practice by this company that causes financial harm to borrowers.                                                                                                                                                                                                      ...  4    \n",
