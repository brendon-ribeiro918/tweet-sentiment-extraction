project1- Tweet Sentiment Extraction

My ridiculous dog is amazing." [sentiment: positive]

With all of the tweets circulating every second it is hard to tell whether the sentiment behind a specific tweet will impact a company, or a person's, brand for being viral (positive), or devastate profit because it strikes a negative tone. Capturing sentiment in language is important in these times where decisions and reactions are created and updated in seconds. But, which words actually lead to the sentiment description? 

In this project i will be working with what words in tweets support a positive, negative, or neutral sentiment? 

OBJECTIVE: Your objective is to construct a model that can do the same - look at the labeled sentiment for a given tweet and figure out what word or phrase best supports it.
